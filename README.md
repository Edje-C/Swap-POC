## What is Swap?
Swap is an application created to allow friends to listen to music without worrying about what's playing.

Here we have the home page which is also your profile where you can see all the playlists you have created and have been invited to.

## How do I use Swap?

#### Creating a Swap
---
To create a Swap click on the '+' button in the bottom right corner which will render the 'new' page. 

Give your playlist a title, add your friends, and select your playlist length. Hit done and Swap will collect tracks from your Spotify account.

#### Collaborating and saving
---
If you've been invited to a playlist, you can accept the invitation by clicking the '+' button and decline by clicking the '-' button.

The invitation buttons will be replaced by either 'Pending' which means there are still users that need to accept or decline or 'Ready To Save' which means the Swap initializer can save the playlist to their Spotify account.

If you are the playlist initializer when every collaborator has accepted or declined their invitation you will see a button 'Save To Spotify' which, when clicked, will save the playlist to your Spotify account and the playlist name will become a link to your playlist.

## How does Swap work?

Swap will calculate how many songs are needed for each user. 
If you're a Spotify Premium user Swap will populate your part of the playlist divided by:  
- 70%  saved songs
- 15% top songs
- 15% recommendations based on your top songs. 

Free users will have their part of the playlist split 3 ways: 
- 34% top songs
- 33% recommendations based on your top songs
- 33% top songs from your top artists.
